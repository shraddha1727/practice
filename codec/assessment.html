    <p >Penguins are flightless birds known for their black and white feathers and waddling walk, adapted to living in the Southern Hemisphere. They are excellent swimmers, using their wings as flippers to navigate the water, and eat fish, squid, and other seafood. Penguins live primarily in cold climates, with the Galapagos penguin being the exception, found slightly north of the equator. 
        <br>
        The word penguin first appears in literature at the end of the 16th century as a synonym for the great auk.[11] When European explorers discovered what are today known as penguins in the Southern Hemisphere, they noticed their similar appearance to the great auk of the Northern Hemisphere and named them after this bird, although they are not closely related.[12]
